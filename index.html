                        The Neon Games Project is a collection of HTML games with a neon theme developed by the Fundara Foundation and FumetsuChigura team. The project aims to create simple and easy-to-play games that are modern and visually appealing. The team used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create games that are accessible and playable on various devices. They have created several games, such as Tic Tac Toe, Lighted Text, Snake, and Pong, and plan to promote them on social media and game forums. The project has helped the team hone their programming and design skills and taught them how to build a project from start to finish. Ultimately, the project aims to provide a source of entertainment and gain experience for the team.

                            <p>The Neon Games Project is a project currently being developed by the Fundara Foundation and FumetsuChigura team. The Neon Games Project is a collection of HTML games with a neon theme. The project aims to expand the popularity of the games we create, both outside and inside the project, as well as to hone our working skills.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>We chose the neon theme because we feel that it gives a modern and appealing look to the games. Additionally, we wanted to create games that are simple and easy to play, so they do not require a long time to learn.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>In this project, we have created several games, such as Tic Tac Toe, Lighted Text (not included as a game but a part of the project), and several other games that we will create in the future, such as Snake, Pong, and more. Tic Tac Toe is a classic game that is very popular, while Snake and Pong were very popular games during the console game era.</p>
                            <br>
                            
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <p>We also designed the games using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript technologies to make them easily accessible and playable by many people. In this regard, we strive to make games that can be played through a website and are responsive, so they can be played on various types of devices such as laptops, desktops, and smartphones.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>To increase the popularity of our games, we plan to promote our games on various platforms, such as social media and game forums. We will also ask for feedback from users of our games to continue improving the quality of our games in the future.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>In creating this project, we have gained many benefits, such as honing our programming skills and designing game interfaces. Additionally, we learned how to build a project from start to finish.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Overall, this project has been very beneficial for us in honing our skills and providing experience in building a project from start to finish. We hope that the games we create will be accepted by the community and provide good benefits to users. Ultimately, this project is just a means for us to gain experience and provide a source of entertainment to users.</p>
